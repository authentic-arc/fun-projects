#1. Space Invaders:
 A simple retro styled Space Invaders game using Pygame. You control a green ship that glides across the bottom of the screen, firing red bullets to take down white enemies that move in a grid above you. The enemies shift left and right, dropping down whenever they hit the edges, adding to the challenge. To help you survive, there are green bunkers for cover.
