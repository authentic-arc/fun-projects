#1. Space Invaders:
 A simple retro styled Space Invaders game using Pygame. You control a green ship that glides across the bottom of the screen, firing red bullets to take down white enemies that move in a grid above you. The enemies shift left and right, dropping down whenever they hit the edges, adding to the challenge. To help you survive, there are green bunkers for cover. 
 
#2. Hangman:
A fun game of Hangman where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. At the start, the game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player is informed of how many letters it contains. With six tries to guess wrong, players enter letters or even try to guess the entire word. As players uncover letters, they can see their progress displayed, and the excitement builds until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.

#3. Ping Pong:
An interactive Virtual Ping Pong game of two players. Players control two paddles: the left paddle is moved with the W (up) and S (down) keys, while the right paddle is controlled using the Up and Down arrow keys. The goal is to hit a bouncing ball back and forth, with each player scoring points when the opponent misses. As the ball travels across the screen, it bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom walls, adding excitement to each rally. 

#4 Tick Tac Toe:
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to compete against each other. The game features a musical backdrop that can be paused, resumed, or exited with the 'p', 'r', and 'e' keys, respectively. Players take turns clicking on a grid to place their marksâ€”red squares for player one and green circles for player two. The game checks for a winner after each turn, with the option to reset the board by pressing the SPACE key. It's a simple yet engaging way to enjoy a timeless game with friends.
